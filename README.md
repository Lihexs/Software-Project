# Software Project (0368-2161) - Clustering Algorithms
## Due Date: 08/10/2023

## Introduction
This project focuses on the implementation of a clustering algorithm based on Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF). In addition to SymNMF, we've also developed a K-means clustering algorithm for comparative analysis across multiple datasets.

## Highlights
- Custom Python library developed in C to enhance clustering performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- C Compiler

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the C library.
4. Install Python dependencies.

## Usage
1. Import the custom library.
2. Run SymNMF clustering.
3. Run K-means clustering for comparison.
